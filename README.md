# DrinkUp
This is a simple application made on Unity with C# that allows a person to insert the amount of ounces of liquid they drink 
in a day and adds up to a total running sum. When the bottle is filled up to 8 ounces, the text will display the number 
of bottles drank with the remaining ounces it has before another bottle is filled.
